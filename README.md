Application Description: SafiriCare
Purpose & Regional Relevance in South Africa

SafiriCare is a one-stop service marketplace designed to empower South Africans by simplifying access to essential household and logistical services. The app connects users with trusted local providers for babysitting, cleaning, tutoring, moving services, and more, while prioritizing affordability, reliability, and scalability.

Support gig workers in townships and rural areas (e.g., Soweto, Khayelitsha).

Ensure Safety & Trust:

Verify provider credentials (e.g., background checks, user reviews).

Offer secure in-app payments to protect both users and workers.

Scalable Design:

Build a flexible platform to add new services (e.g., plumbing, event planning) based on community demand.
